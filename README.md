# Teikei

Teikei is the software that powers [Ernte teilen][ernteteilen], a website that maps out [Community Supported Agriculture][csa] in Germany.

## Getting started

The framework consists of two components: the API back-end and the front-end. The back-end is based on [Ruby on Rails][rubyonrails]. Data is exchanged as JSON. The front-end is built with the help of [Marionette.js][marionettejs] and [Backbone.js][backbonejs]. The website is designed to work as a single-page-application, at least for the major parts of the interface.

### Settings

You need to create an `.env` file which contains the environment variables needed to run the project. The included `.env.sample` file lists the variables which need to be set.

### External dependencies (package managers)

Unlike most classic Rails projects, this application uses separate package management for its client-side dependencies. In order to build the front-end of this application, you will need [bower][bower] in addition to Bundler. Bower will install all external client-side packages into the `/vendor/assets/bower_components` folder.

#### Prerequisites for using bower:

- a working [node.js][nodejs] installation
- a global installation of [Bower][bower]: `npm install -g bower`

#### Installing/updating dependencies:

1. Run `bundle install` (installs Ruby dependencies)
2. Run `bower install` (installs client-side dependencies)

### Test data

* A superadmin account can be generated by running `rake db:seed`.
* Test data in general (users, farms, depots, faqs) can be generated by running `rake db:seed:generate`.
* The task `rake db:seed:all` runs both tasks mentioned before.

## Roadmap

We use [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/teikei/teikei/issues) to plan upcoming features and track our bugs. If you want to participate, it's probably a good idea to look for open issues there. Before working on bigger features, however, it's advisable to get in contact with us, so that we can coordinate progress a little.

## Known issues

- On Ubuntu there might be an issue running `bundle install`. There is a dependency for `libcrypto.so.0.9.8`. To circumvend the problem install `libssl0.9.8`.
- Because of an issue with Backbone/Marionette, the project is currently not compatible with npm3.
